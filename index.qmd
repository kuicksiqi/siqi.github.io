## A little backstory 

I was born in Singapore, but for more than half of my life I have been travelling back and forth from Singapore to USA, more specifically Dallas, Texas. All due to my father's occupation as an Airforce engineer, we had the opportunity to travel to the United States of America. Allowing me new experiences and new friends both from Singapore and Texas. But of course it was hard managing these friends as I would only be staying at Singapore or Texas for 2 to 3 years and I would have to fly off, which made me very adaptable to new environments.

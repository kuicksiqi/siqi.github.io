For this game we had to start out with a game engine and then built on the context.\n\n\nThe game we made it like snakes and ladders where there is an avatar that the player can control and move it up, down, left and right. The player‚Äôs objective is to eat the healthy foods and avoid the unhealthy foods, if the players eats the healthy foods it will earn points if not the player will be stunned and deduct points, if the player doesn‚Äôt have enough points by the time the game ends, the player will not be able to go to the next level.\nIf you would like to see the project: click this link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the game looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\nGame over.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next level."
